\section{Experiments} In this section, you should
present the results you achieved with various experiments. The results
can be presented in tables, plots, etc. 

The purpose of the project is to analyze the nature and effectiveness of different GAN architectures as well as different improvement options. The different models  but in order to do so a frame of reference was needed 

\subsection{DCGAN}
In order to establish a frame of reference a plain vanilla version of DCGAN using 

\subsection{DCGAN with Spectral Normalization}

\subsection{LSGAN}

\subsection{WGAN}
