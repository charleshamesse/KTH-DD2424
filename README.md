# Spectral Normalization for GANs Using Inception Score
Final project for the course Deep Learning in Data Science at KTH.

In this project we evaluated the effect of spectral normalization on various DCGAN configurations.

We started with a vanilla DCGAN and iteratively considered modification in an attempt to improve the networks performance.

Evaluation was done on the CIFAR10 dataset and on a dataset consisting of 20K reptile pictures gathered using the FLICKR API.
